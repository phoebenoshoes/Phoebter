Reminds you to refresh Elixir of Tongues, Inky Black Potion and Projection Prism when they are close to expiring, and reapplies them for you if you accept. Reminders for each buff can be toggled on and off, which will be saved across your account. Type '/pb' or '/phoebter' in-game for a full list of available commands. 

Automatic refreshing for Projection Prism can be toggled separately to reminders, as it uses the nearest group member - it is recommended to only turn this on when in a party that are all using the same appearance, and it will be turned off each time you log in/reload. 

Phoebter will only check if your buffs are close to expiring when you send or receive a message in spatial channels (/s, /e and /y,) so it will only work when you are in active RP.
